# Predicting House Prices with Machine Learning

This project focuses on using machine learning techniques to predict house prices based on various features and attributes of houses. This README provides an overview of the project and its components.

## Introduction

In this project, we develop a machine learning model to predict house prices. This README serves as a guide to understand and replicate our work.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python libraries and dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Follow the instructions in the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python script.

## Data Collection

Explain how the dataset was obtained, including sources and the attributes included.

## Data Preprocessing

Describe data cleaning, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.

## Feature Engineering

Explain any feature engineering techniques used to enhance model performance.

## Model Selection

Detail the choice of the machine learning algorithm (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) for house price prediction.

## Training

Provide instructions on how to train the selected model using the dataset.

## Evaluation

Explain the metrics used to assess the model's performance, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.

## Hyperparameter Tuning

Discuss how model hyperparameters were tuned to optimize predictive accuracy.

## Predictions

Explain how to use the trained model to make house price predictions.

## Model Deployment

If applicable, describe how to deploy the model, such as creating a web application or API for real-time predictions.
